# Step

First, I installed VirtualBox software.

Then, I installed Bbunto as a virtual machine.

After that, I Downloaded ROS melodic software from the terminal.

Then, after setting the environmental variables, I installed all dependencies needed for building packages.

Also, I used "get clone" to import the robot arm.

After that I installed all dependencies and compile the package.

Finally, I used "roslaunch" to lunch RViz and control the arm.
